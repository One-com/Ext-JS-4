    <h1>Loading Nested Data</h1>
    
    <p>This example shows how it's easy to load any kind of data and render it to a page. It doesn't matter if your data is simple or complex, nested loading takes care of everything for you.</p>
    
    <p>
        Here we want to display a few products which have user reviews. We set up 2 models - Product and Review - that represent the data in the app. Each Product is tied to one or more Reviews. We use a Store to load
        data over AJAX (<a href="products.json">see the raw JSON</a> we're loading). Finally we use a DataView to render the data any way we wish.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Our DataView renders each Product automatically when the Store is loaded. In this case we've added a couple of simple functions to calculate the average rating and to show and hide the review comments. The 
        <a href="NestedLoading.js">example source</a> is simple and has plenty of comments to guide you through the example.
